##### Welcome to our first code! 
# as mentioned in the presentation, "#" allows you to talk without running code
# this is used to annotate your code to make sure you and anyone who views your code can understand what is being done
# whenever you see "#", it's me talking to you 

## Now, Let's start with some basic R language
# run the following lines and view the output by hitting "run" or command enter
# look below in the console for the output 

1+1

# this is a very simple output
# let's make it a value in our environment (top right section) by using "<-"

df <- 1+1

# you should see df 2 under values in your environment section 
# now, if we ever need to refer to it, we can call it by typing "df"

df

# this is the basics of creating data frames in R... using "<-" to name our data then calling it by that name
# let's make a more robust data frame with a few numbers in it
# to do this, we will use a concatenate function: c()
# and we will use a data frame function: data.frame()

Name <- c("Ian", "Lucas", "Tim", "Rachel", "Brandon")
Age <- c(21, 21, 22, 23, 25)

siblings <- data.frame(Name, Age)
